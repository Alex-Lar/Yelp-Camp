# Vanilla YelpCamp

This is the repository for the original version of the YelpCamp project (not the original repository) by Colt Steele from the Udemy course [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp). This project serves as a capstone project, showcasing skills learned throughout the course.

## Overview

YelpCamp is a full-stack web application that allows users to create and review campgrounds. It is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap, providing a practical implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- Users can view all campgrounds without an account.
- Users must log in to create, edit, or delete campgrounds and reviews.
- Persistent data storage using MongoDB.
- User authentication handled with Passport.js.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **Bootstrap**: To create responsive designs quickly.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and campground data.
- **Passport.js**: Middleware for handling authentication.
